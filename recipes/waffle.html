        <h2>waffles ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
                <li>Eggs: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
                <li>Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
                <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
                <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
                <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
                <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
                <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
                <li>Cooking spray: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>step 1</li>
            Sprinkle yeast and white sugar over warm milk in a small bowl. The milk should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.

            <li>step 2</li>
            Whisk eggs, melted butter, and vanilla into the yeast mixture until evenly blended; set aside.

            <li>step 3</li>
            Stir together flour and salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well, then stir in the flour mixture until a soft dough forms. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place, 80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C), until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Gently mix in the pearl sugar.

            <li>step 4</li>
            Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.

            <li>step 5</li>
            Place a baseball-sized ball of dough on the preheated waffle iron. Cook waffles until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough. Allow waffles to cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.

        </ul>
