        <p>
        I've been using this blackberry pie recipe for years and have always succeeded with it! Frozen or fresh blackberries can be used. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

        <h2>Blackberry Pie Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 cups fresh blackberries</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) double crust ready-to-use pie crust</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Combine 3 1/2 cups of blackberries with 1/2 cup sugar and flour in a large bowl. Spoon mixture into the unbaked pie crust. Spread remaining 1/2 cup berries on top of sweetened berries, and cover with the top crust. Seal and crimp the edges, and cut vents in the top crust for steam to escape.</li>

            <li>Brush the top crust with milk and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar.</li>

            <li>Bake pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature of the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until filling is bubbly and crust is golden brown, an additional 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire rack.</li>
            
        </ol>
